# Package name mapping between Homebrew and apt
# Key is the canonical name (usually brew name)
#
# Fields:
#   brew        - Homebrew package name (optional, defaults to key)
#   apt         - apt package name (optional, omit if no apt package)
#   apt_cmd     - Command name on apt if different from package name
#   mode        - Installation mode: "base", "development", "desktop"
#   darwin_only - true = brew install on macOS only, skip on Linux (default: false)
#
# OS routing (automatic):
#   macOS  -> brew (if brew field exists)
#   Linux  -> apt (if apt field exists), otherwise brew (unless darwin_only)
