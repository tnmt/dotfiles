# Package name mapping between Homebrew and apt
# Key is the canonical name (usually brew name)
#
# Fields:
#   brew      - Homebrew package name (optional, defaults to key)
#   apt       - apt package name (optional, omit if no apt package)
#   apt_cmd   - Command name on apt if different from package name
#   mode      - Installation mode: "base", "development", "desktop"
#   brew_os   - OS for brew install: "all", "darwin", "linux" (default: "all")
#               "darwin" means brew only on macOS (Linux uses apt)
